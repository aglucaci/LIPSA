Analysis Description
--------------------
GARD : Genetic Algorithms for Recombination Detection. Implements a
heuristic approach to screening alignments of sequences for
recombination, by using the CHC genetic algorithm to search for
phylogenetic incongruence among different partitions of the data. The
number of partitions is determined using a step-up procedure, while the
placement of breakpoints is searched for with the GA. The best fitting
model (based on c-AIC) is returned; and additional post-hoc tests run to
distinguish topological incongruence from rate-variation. v0.2 adds and
spooling results to JSON after each breakpoint search conclusion
